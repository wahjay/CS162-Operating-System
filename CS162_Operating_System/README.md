## Pintos Operating System (Summer at UC Berkeley)

### Course Info

The purpose of this course is to teach the design of operating systems and operating systems concepts that appear in other computer systems. Topics we will cover include concepts of operating systems, system programming, networked and distributed systems, and storage systems, including multiple-program systems (processes, interprocess communication, and synchronization), memory allocation (segmentation, paging), resource allocation and scheduling, file systems, basic networking (sockets, layering, APIs, reliability), transactions, security, and privacy.

We will be using the Pintos educational operating system for all three projects.


### Project 3

Project 3 folder contains a `inode.c` file, where I implemented the `Fast File System` for the Pintos Operating system.
The whole Pintos code base is too large so I won't include all of it in here. Besices, I only reponsible for implementing the file system in my team for this project; thus there is no need to inlcude other people's work.


### Project 2
Project 2 folder contains a `process.c` file and a `syscall.c` file. 


### Project 1
We implemented multithreading and synchronization in Project 1. But I didn't have a copy of the project 1, so I didn't include it here.
