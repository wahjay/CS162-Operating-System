## Pintos Operating System (Summer at UC Berkeley)

### Project 3

Project 3 folder contains a `inode.c` file, where I implemented the `Fast File System` for the Pintos Operating system.
The whole Pintos code base is too large so I won't include all of it in here. Besices, I only reponsible for implementing the file system in my team for this project; thus there is no need to inlcude other people's work.


### Project 2
Project 2 folder contains a `process.c` file and a `syscall.c` file. 


### Project 1
We implemented multithreading and synchronization in Project 1. But I didn't have a copy of the project 1, so I didn't include it here.
