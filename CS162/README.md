Project 3 folder contains a `inode.c` file, where I implemented the `Fast File System` for the Pintos Operating system.
The whole Pintos code base is too large so I won't include all of it in here. Besices, I only reponsible for implementing the file system in my team for this project; thus there is no need to inlcude other people's work.
