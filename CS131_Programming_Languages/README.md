## Programming Languages


### Course Objective

Expose the student to an analytic and comparative way of looking at programming languages and their implementation.

### Course Description

Basic concepts in design and use of programming languages, including abstraction, modularity, control mechanisms, types, declarations, syntax, and semantics. Study of several different language paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and logic programming.
